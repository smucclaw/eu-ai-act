Subject:            Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council
                    laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence
                    Act) and amending certain Union legislative acts
                    - Preparation for the trilogue

DOCUMENT PARTIALLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC (02.08.2023)
INTRODUCTION

1.   The Commission adopted the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on
     artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) on 21 April 2021.


2.   The Council unanimously adopted its General Approach on the proposal on 6 December
     2022.

3.   The European Parliament (hereinafter: EP) confirmed its position in a plenary vote on 14 June
     2023.




11320/1/23 REV 1                                                           RB/st                   1

4.    Also on 14 June 2023, immediately after the vote in the EP, the co-legislators and the
      European Commission held the first political trilogue on the AI Act, during which all three
      institutions outlined their priorities for the negotiations and the technical level was given a
      broad mandate to work on the entire proposal. Since then, two technical meetings and some
      informal contacts between the negotiating teams have taken place, in order to advance the
      discussions on some of the less controversial aspects of the proposal and to prepare the second
      political trilogue, which has been scheduled for 18 July 2023.

5.    On 5 July 2023, the Presidency held an all-day meeting of the Working Party on
      Telecommunications and Information Society (hereinafter: WP TELECOM), during which
      delegations were invited to express their initial views on the topics that are going to be
      discussed during the second political trilogue on 18 July 2023.




II.   STATE OF PLAY

6.    During the technical meetings held so far, the following parts of the text have been discussed
      and prepared for confirmation at political level:


       -   Obligations of providers and users/deployers of high-risk AI systems and other
           parties (Articles 16-27, with the exception of Article 23a and Article 24)
           [rows 307-350c, 353-373b]
       -   Notifying authorities and notified bodies (Articles 30-39)
           [rows 389-442]
       -   Standards, conformity assessment, certificates, registration (Articles 40-50, with the
           exception of Article 47)
           [rows 443-484a, 492-508]


7.    In Section I of the Annex, delegations will find the amendments made to the text by the EP
      and the Council with regard to the provisions mentioned above in the fourth column ("Draft
      Agreement"). As compared to the Commission's proposal, changes are marked as bold italics
      (additions) and strikethrough (deletions).




11320/1/23 REV 1                                                         RB/st                     2
                                              TREE.2.B           LIMITE                         EN
8.   The rows marked as green have been provisionally agreed with the EP at the technical level.
     The rows marked as yellow have also been provisionally agreed, subject to final checks by the
     EP, and are likely to be turned green before the second trilogue. Some elements in those rows
     have been placed in [square brackets] or are marked in red, which means that they will be
     adjusted at a later stage, subject to solutions on higher-level issues such as governance,
     foundation models/general purpose AI systems or exceptions for law enforcement authorities.
     During the meeting of WP TELECOM on 5 July 2023 delegations made several comments
     concering these proposals, which have been duly taken into account by the Presidency. The
     Presidency considers the compromise proposals in green and yellow to fall within the
     Council’s Genral Approach from 6 December 2022 but it intends to ask the Permanent
     Representatives Committee for confirmation during its meeting on 14 July 2023.

IV.       CONCLUSION

12.       In light of the above, and with a view to obtaining a revised mandate for trilogue negotiations
          on the AI Act, the Permanent Representatives Committee is invited to:


            endorse the compromise proposals referred to in section III, point 6 of this note;

            indicate flexibility with regard to the topics and questions presented in section III,
             points 10 and 11 of this note.

                                 3. The obligation outlined under

                                 use of the high-risk AI system.
                                   The deployer may, in similar
                                 cases, draw back on previously

                              providers. If, during the use of the
                               high-risk AI system, the deployer
                              considers that the criteria listed in
                              paragraph 1 are not longer met, it
                               shall conduct a new fundamental

                                   4. In the course of the impact
                              assessment, the deployer, with the
                                 exception of SMEs, shall shall
                                    notify national supervisory

                                 1, including but not limited to:
                                    equality bodies, consumer
                                    protection agencies, social

                               input into the impact assessment.
                               The deployer shall allow a period
                              of six weeks for bodies to respond.
